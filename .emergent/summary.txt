The trajectory details the iterative development of a full-stack e-commerce application, Aparna Diwali Delights. The process began with initial exploration and environment setup, including fixing a critical  configuration issue. The development then progressed through a series of user-driven requests.

Early tasks focused on UI cleanup and branding, such as removing a Made with Emergent badge and updating the copyright year. A significant security improvement was made by moving hardcoded credentials from the source code () to environment variables in a newly created  file.

The core of the work involved substantial feature development and UI enhancements. A comprehensive admin panel was built from scratch, including backend models (Pydantic), FastAPI routes for analytics and order management, and a complex React frontend component ().

Numerous UI/UX tweaks followed, including removing category icons, renaming categories, applying gradient colors to buttons and sections for a modern look, and adding dummy product ratings/reviews. The Greetings feature underwent a major refactoring, moving from a confusing multi-template system to a simple, elegant artwork selection gallery.

Throughout the process, the AI engineer addressed multiple bugs, including JSX syntax errors, mobile responsiveness issues (header size, horizontal scrolling), and caching problems that prevented UI updates from appearing. The final set of tasks focused on refining the greeting card design based on user-uploaded artwork, culminating in the integration of a specific template with text placeholders.

The application is a standard full-stack monorepo with separate  and  directories.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Modifications:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The root component of the React application. It handles routing, main layout, state management for cart and filters, and renders the header, footer, and main content.

<pending_tasks>
- Verify the implementation of the latest user-provided greeting card template. The code has been updated to position text over placeholders in the new artwork, but its visual correctness on the frontend has not been confirmed.
- Await user feedback on the latest changes to the greeting card design.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was a complete redesign of the greeting card preview in the Greetings feature, based on direct user feedback and a new image asset. The user provided a specific greeting card image that already contained graphical text for Happy Diwali and placeholders for To, From, and the message.

The work involved:
1.  **Integrating the New Artwork:** The user-uploaded image was added to the  array in  with a special .

2.  **Updating the Rendering Logic:** The JSX for the live preview within  was significantly modified. A conditional rendering block was introduced to handle the new placeholder-based template differently from the other artworks. For this specific template, instead of rendering the standard card layout, the code now positions the , , and  text using absolute positioning with specific , , and  CSS classes to align them with the placeholder areas on the background image.

3.  **Removing Animations:** All animations (like ) were removed from the preview to ensure the card is static, making it suitable for downloading and sharing as a static image.

4.  **Restarting the Service:** The final action was restarting the frontend service (frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started) to apply these changes. The next step is to verify if this new layout renders correctly on the frontend.
